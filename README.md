# Geospatial-Programming-and-Analysis
I like spatial graphs :)

This repo is dedicated to my geospatial projects overtime, for the handling of data that help compute and analyze contemporary discourse in various sample groups/societies. I'll play with a lot of packages, and a lot of APIs here, possibly some data storytelling too because code about people shouldn't be boring.
